## 📖 About The Project

LLMs like ChatGPT often hallucinate academic citations—inventing papers that sound real but don't exist. **Veru** acts as a forensic auditor for your research.

It extracts citations from your text and cross-references them against massive academic databases to verify their existence and content accuracy.

### Key Features

* **🕵️‍♂️ Anti-Hallucination Extraction**: Uses Gemini 2.0 to strictly extract citations without "autocorrecting" user errors.
* **📚 Multi-Database Verification**:
    * **Tier 1**: Checks **OpenAlex** (250M+ works) with smart title matching.
    * **Tier 2**: Fallback to **Semantic Scholar** if OpenAlex misses.
    * **Tier 3**: Final forensic sweep using **Google Search Grounding**.
* **🧠 Content Consistency Check**: Compares the user's claim against the *actual* abstract to detect mismatched summaries ("stitched" hallucinations).
* **💾 Local History**: Automatically saves your audit sessions locally.

### 🧠 The Audit Pipeline

> **Processing Logic:**
> 1. **User Input** → LLM Extraction
> 2. **Verification Layer**:
>    * Check **OpenAlex** 🟢 (Primary)
>    * *If miss* → Check **Semantic Scholar** 🟡 (Fallback)
>    * *If miss* → Check **Google Search** 🔵 (Grounding)
> 3. **Consistency Check**: Real Abstract vs. User Claim
> 4. **Output**: ✅ Real / 🛑 Fake / ⚠️ Mismatch

## 1. The "Why": Beyond Metadata Verification

### The "Stitched Hallucination" Problem
During my research, I noticed a subtle but dangerous behavior in LLMs (ChatGPT/Claude). They often don't just invent papers; they **stitch** real citations with fake findings.
* **Real Paper**: "Attention Is All You Need" by Ashish Vaswani et al. (2017).
* **Fake Claim**: "The paper introduces a fully convolutional sequence-to-sequence model with attention, enabling parallel training and achieving competitive or state-of-the-art results on WMT machine translation benchmarks." (actually from “Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning” by Gehring et al. (2017)）

**The Gap in Existing Tools**:
Most citation checkers only verify **Existence** (Does this title/author exist?). They fail to verify **Content Consistency** (Does the paper actually support the claim?).

**Veru's Mission**: To act not just as a librarian, but as a **Forensic Auditor**, verifying both existence and semantic accuracy.

---

## 2. Technical Architecture

### The "Race Condition" Strategy (Data Sources)
I needed a balance between **Volume** and **Precision**.
1.  **OpenAlex (Primary)**: Chosen for its massive index (250M+ works) and free API. It handles the "Recall" problem.
2.  **Semantic Scholar (Fallback)**: Used to "fill in the gaps". During testing, I found its abstract and year data to be more precise than OpenAlex.
3.  **Google Search (Grounding)**: The final safety net.

**Logic**:
We launch requests to OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar in parallel. The system prioritizes OpenAlex for coverage but falls back to Semantic Scholar if metadata is incomplete, using a custom scoring algorithm to pick the "Best Candidate".

### AsyncIO & Performance
**Challenge**: Batch processing citations sequentially was prohibitively slow.

**Solution**: Implemented Python \`asyncio\`.
* **Before**: Linear blocking. 5 citations ≈ 15s+.
* **After**: Concurrent execution. 5 citations ≈ 2-3s.
* **Impact**: Massive UX improvement for users checking long literature reviews.

## 3. Engineering Challenges

### The "Over-Helpful" AI Paradox
**The Bug**:
Early versions of Veru had a 0% False Positive rate, which was suspicious. When I fed it a fake description of a real paper, Veru marked it as "REAL".

**Root Cause**:
Gemini 2.0 Flash is *too smart*. When extracting citations from user text, it recognized the real paper and **auto-corrected** the user's fake description to match reality before the verification step even began.

**The Fix**:
I had to engineer "Strict Extraction Prompts".
* *Old Prompt*: "Extract the citations."
* *New Prompt*: "Extract citations EXACTLY as written. Do NOT correct user errors. If the user claims 'Sky is Green', extract 'Sky is Green'."

### Why Gemini 2.0 Flash?
* **Cost vs. Intelligence**: It strikes the perfect balance for a free tool.
* **Context Window**: Crucial for processing full abstracts without truncation.

---

## 4. Reflections & Roadmap

### The "Full Stack" Reality
Building Veru taught me that "shipping" is only 50% of the work. The other 50% is the "Brand" — SEO, social media presence, and user trust. Technical excellence needs visibility.

### What's Next?
* **PDF Analysis**: Upload a full paper to check all references at once.
* **Writing Assistant**: Suggesting real literature based on draft content.
* **Plagiarism Detection**: Integration with traditional similarity checks.

// Grade Calc project
const GRADECALC_README = `# GradeCalc: Statistical Grade Planner

> **A privacy-focused grade calculator built to cure exam anxiety.**
> [Visit Live App](https://grade.peterguan.com)

## 💡 The "Why"
Traditional calculators only tell you *what* you need (e.g., "You need 92%"), but they don't tell you *how hard* that is based on your history. I built GradeCalc to act as a financial risk analyst for your GPA.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Bento Grid UI**: A responsive, editorial-style layout inspired by modern Swiss design.
* **Risk Analysis**: Uses **Standard Deviation** to generate "Safe" vs "Hard" ratings.
* **Visual Feedback**: Stacked bar charts to visualize "Secured" vs "Potential" grades.
* **Privacy First**: 100% Client-side. No data leaves the browser.

## 🧠 How the "AI" Works
Instead of simple subtraction, GradeCalc uses a rule-based statistical algorithm:

1.  **Volatility Check**: Calculates the standard deviation (σ) of your assignment history.
2.  **Z-Score Determination**:
    Calculates how many standard deviations away your goal is from your average.
    \`Z = (Required Final - Average) / σ\`
3.  **Decision Matrix**:
    * If Z > 1.5 (or Gap > 10%): Rated as **Hard** (Requires outperforming your usual self).
    * If Z < 0.5: Rated as **Safe/Normal**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Core**: Vanilla JS (ES6+), HTML5
* **Styling**: CSS Variables, Glassmorphism
* **Development Time**: 4 Hours (MVP)

    const safeSD = (sd && sd > 1) ? sd : 2;
    
    // Z-Score: How many standard deviations away is the goal?
    const zScore = gap / safeSD;

    if (required > 100) {
        return { text: "Mathematically impossible without extra credit.", style: 'impossible' };
    }
    if (required <= 0) {
        return { text: "Grade secured! You can technically skip the final.", style: 'safe' };

## 1. The Spark: Escaping "Spreadsheet Hell"

### The Friction of Finals Week
It started on a stressful morning before finals. I needed to know exactly what score I needed to secure an 'A' (90%+).
* **The Calculator Trap**: Simple calculators required me to memorize intermediate scores. I got lost in the numbers.
* **The Excel Fatigue**: I tried Excel, then VBA. While I got it working, the context switching was mentally draining. I'd forget what specific cells represented the moment I looked away.
* **The Ad-Filled Web**: Existing online tools were functional but riddled with distracting ads and lacked any form of meaningful analysis.

**The Decision**:
The weighted calculation logic is simple; the friction was entirely in the User Interface. I decided to build a tool that solved the *anxiety*, not just the math.

---

## 2. HCI Insight: From Calculation to "Risk Assessment"

### The Anxiety Gap
My initial goal was just "What do I need to score?". But I realized a deeper psychological issue: **Miscalibrated Anxiety**.
* **Scenario**: I had a 95% average, and the final was only 20% of the grade. I technically only needed a 70% to keep my 'A', yet I was stressing as if I needed a 85%.
* **The Solution**: I moved beyond raw numbers. Instead of just saying "You need 98%", the app provides a **Qualitative Analysis**.

### The "Goal Simulator"
I added a "What-If" slider because everyone's threshold is different. Some struggle to Pass (50%), others fight for an A (90%).
The slider allows for **Marginal Analysis**: "How much harder do I need to study to gain just 1% more in my final grade?" It turns abstract stress into concrete data.

---

## 3. Engineering Decisions: The Art of Restraint

### Why Vanilla JS? (No React?)
As a developer proficient in Next.js, using Vanilla JS was a deliberate choice for **Constraint**:
1.  **Zero-Friction Dev**: No \`npm install\`, no build steps. I could write code in a lightweight editor and test by double-clicking the \`.html\` file.
2.  **Performance**: The site loads instantly. For a single-page utility, downloading a framework bundle is inefficient.
3.  **Portability**: The entire app is just 3 files. It's the ultimate "Serverless" architecture.

### The "Sledgehammer" Trap: LLM vs. Statistics
**Initial Thought**: Connect to an LLM API (like GPT/Gemini) to give study advice based on grades.

**The Pivot**: I realized this was "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut."
* **Latency**: LLMs are slow.
* **Cost**: APIs cost money/tokens.
* **Solution**: I implemented a **Z-Score Algorithm** (Standard Deviation). It statistically predicts the "difficulty" of a goal based on historical grade volatility. It provides the same "advice" value as an LLM, but with **0ms latency** and **zero cost**.

---

## 4. Design & Impact

### Swiss Style & Bento Grids
I chose the Bento Grid layout not just for aesthetics, but for **Mobile Responsiveness**. The modular "box" structure stacks perfectly on phones, which is where I check my grades most often. The "Swiss Style" (high contrast, bold type) keeps the focus on the data, reducing visual clutter.

### The Result
* **Time to Ship**: 4 Hours. This includes the UI iteration (refined with design feedback from Gemini).
* **User Feedback**: Friends who used it found the "Advice" feature surprisingly grounding. It transformed a tool they thought they didn't need into something they now rely on.
